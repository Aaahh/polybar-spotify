# polybar-spotify

---

This is a module that shows the current song playing and its primary artist on Spotify, with a Spotify-green underline, for people that don't want to set up mpd. If Spotify is not active, nothing is shown. If the song name is longer than `trunclen` characers (default 25), it is truncated and `...` is appended. If the song is truncated and contains a single opening parenthesis, the closing paranethsis is appended as well.

This module requires python 3.x and the `dbus` module.
